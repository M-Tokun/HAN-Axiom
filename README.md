## Visual Proof of Concept

### 1. The Phenomenal Projection (Live Visualization)
This real-time visualization demonstrates the **Dissipative Structure** of the engine.
Observe how the system maintains dynamic equilibrium ("Nirvana") through entropy export ($\sigma - J$).

### 2. Discrete Reality vs. Calculus Illusion
The core discovery of this project: The physical world is not continuous (Blue line), but discrete (Red steps).
Movement only occurs when Tension exceeds the Threshold ($T_c$), creating a "Stick-Slip" dynamic.

### 3. The Core Equation (Step Function)
Unlike differential equations, the state transition $\dot{S}$ is defined by a threshold-based step function:
