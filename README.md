## 1. Overview: From Macro-Approximation to Micro-Reality

This project introduces the **Intensional Dynamics Engine (IDE)**, codenamed **HAN**. It is a theoretical and computational framework that reinterprets physical reality not as a continuous space, but as a discrete, topological process driven by information gradients.

### The Two Layers of Truth
We propose a hierarchical understanding of physics:

* **The Blue Layer (Macro-Approximation):**
    Calculus and Newtonian physics are valid "Macro-Approximations". They describe the world as smooth and continuous, effectively modeling the "Shadow" (Projected Reality) of the underlying mechanics.
* **The Red Layer (Micro-Reality):**
    The HAN engine models the "Micro-Foundation". At this level, reality is **discrete**, driven by **stick-slip dynamics** (threshold-based transitions) and **entropy export**.

> **Note to Researchers:** This repository serves as **Prior Art** for the concepts of "Intensional Information Gradient Dynamics" and "Causal Diode Architecture" in AI.

## 2. Visual Proof of Concept

### A. The Phenomenal Projection (Live Visualization)
This real-time visualization demonstrates the **Dissipative Structure** of the engine. Observe how the system maintains **Dynamic Equilibrium (Homeostasis)** through entropy export ($\sigma - J$).

### B. Discrete Reality vs. Calculus Illusion
The core discovery of this project: The physical world is not inherently continuous (Blue line), but discrete (Red steps). Movement only occurs when Tension exceeds the Threshold ($T_c$), creating a "Stick-Slip" dynamic.

### C. The Core Equation (Step Function)
Unlike differential equations that assume continuous change, the state transition $\dot{S}$ in HAN is defined by a threshold-based step function:

## 3. Core Innovations (Novelty Claims)

This system implements unique mechanisms distinct from traditional Neural Networks:

* **Intensional Dynamics (内包的力学):** The system explicitly prohibits spatial variables (`x, y, z`) in its causal core. It is driven solely by **Intensional Information Gradients ($\Delta_{info}$)**.
* **Causal Diode (因果ダイオード):** A strict architecture where Distance is an **Output (Effect)**, never an Input (Cause). We calculate the shadow from the object, but never move the object by pulling its shadow.
* **Discrete Phase Locking (離散位相ロック):** Instead of error correction (which leads to drift), the system uses discrete phase steps. Residuals are discarded to the Effect layer as "Heat/Log," ensuring absolute logical stability.
* **Homeostasis as Dynamic Equilibrium (動的平衡恒常性):** The system defines its stable state not as cessation (zero energy), but as a high-energy dynamic equilibrium where $\omega > 0$ and Work generation is maintained.
